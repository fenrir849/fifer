\title{Residualize a lowess function}
\usage{
residualize.lowess(x, y, return.fitted)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The predictor of interest}

\item{y}{The outcome of interest}
}
\value{
A list of residuals
}
\description{
This function will create an approximate fitted function for a lowess line, then residualize the Y based on the fit of the model
