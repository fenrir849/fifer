\title{Plot Expected and Observed Frequencies (Chi Square)}
\usage{
chisq.plot(list = NULL, v1 = NULL, v2 = NULL, standardize = F, sqrt.y = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{A table containing the variables. If not included, user can include raw data as v1 or v2}

\item{v1}{The first variable (must be a factor)}

\item{v2}{The second variable (also must be a factor)}

\item{standardize}{Logical. Should the results be reported in proportions? (Rather than counts)}
}
\description{
This function will plot the expected vs. observed frequencies from a Chi Square Test and plot them in Barplots.
